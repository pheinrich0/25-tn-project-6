"""
    contract(A, Aindices, B, Bindices, indexpermutation=[])

Contract tensors `A` and `B`.
The legs to be contracted are given by `Aindices` and `Bindices`.

Input:
- `A`, `B` (numeric arrays): the tensors to be contracted.
- `Aindices`, `Bindices` (ordered collection of integers):
    Indices for the legs of `A` and `B` to be contracted. The `Aindices[n]`-th leg of `A`
    will be contracted with the `Bindices[n]`-th leg of `B`. `Aindices` and `Bindices`
    should have the same size. If they are both empty, the result will be the direct product
    of `A` and `B`.
- `indexpermutation` (ordered collection of integers):
    Permutation of of the output tensor's indices to be performed after contraction.

Output:
- Contraction of `A` and `B`. All non-contracted legs are in the following order: first, all
    legs previously attached to `A`, in order, then all legs previously attached to `B`, in
    order.
